# Write a code that estimate the area of a unit disk using the hit-or-miss Monte Carlo method. We know the radius of the unit disk is 1 thus the unit circle is inscribed with a square of legnth 2.
# We could generate samples within this square and count the numer of points falling within the disk
#To test whether the point is inside(hit) or outside(miss) the disk, we simply need to measure the distance of the samples from the origin (the center of the unit disk) and check whether this distance is smaller or equal than the disk radius (1 for a unit disk).
